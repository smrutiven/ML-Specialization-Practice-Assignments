# ML-Specialization-Practice-Assignments
Welcome to my ML Specialization Practice Assignments repository! Here, I showcase my practical knowledge and skills gained through completing assignments from the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University on Coursera. Each assignment is designed to reinforce key concepts and techniques in machine learning and to develop real-world applications of AI.
Sure, here's a brief summary of each of the 18 assignments:

1. Neurons and Layers: Exploring the inner workings of neurons and layers, drawing parallels to regression models and implementing them in TensorFlow.
  
2. Simple Neural Network with TensorFlow: Building a small neural network using TensorFlow to analyze coffee roasting data and understand temperature-duration relationships.

3. Simple Neural Network with NumPy: Implementing the same coffee roasting network using NumPy for neural network construction.

4. Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary): Using a neural network to recognize handwritten digits zero and one, a binary classification task.

5. Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Multiclass): Extending the binary digit recognition to classify digits from zero to nine, a multiclass classification task.

6. Back Propagation using Computation Graph: Understanding the backpropagation algorithm and computation graphs used in gradient descent.

7. Derivatives: Exploring derivatives, their intuitive understanding, and calculating them arithmetically and symbolically.

8. Softmax Function: Understanding and implementing the softmax function, crucial for multiclass classification in neural networks.

9. Applying Machine Learning: Techniques for evaluating and improving machine learning models, focusing on polynomial regression and neural networks.

10. Model Evaluation and Selection: Quantifying a learning algorithm's performance, comparing different models, and understanding bias-variance tradeoff.

11. Diagnosing Bias and Variance: Understanding and fixing high bias and high variance problems in machine learning models.

12. Anomaly Detection: Implementing an anomaly detection algorithm using Gaussian distribution to detect failing servers on a network.

13. K-means Clustering: Implementing the K-means algorithm for data clustering and image compression.

14. Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems: Building a recommender system for movies using collaborative filtering with a neural network.

15. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Implementing PCA for dimensionality reduction and pattern discovery in high-dimensional datasets.

16. Content-based Recommender System: Building a recommender system for movies using content-based filtering with a neural network.

17. Deep Q-Learning - Lunar Lander: Training an agent to safely land a lunar lander on the moon's surface using deep Q-learning.

Each assignment covers a different aspect of machine learning, reinforcement learning, or data analysis, providing hands-on experience with various algorithms and techniques.
